    <h1>I was born at Camden, South Carolina. Living with my Grandparents, my Grandfather was a machanic, and my
        Grandmother didn't work.</h1>
    <h2>I went to school at Pine Tree Hill Elementary until my 4th Grade year, from there I went to Jacksonville
        Elementary School. This School is in Camden, The reason for this transfer is because it was closer, then my
        Grandfather died because he worked himself to death, had two heart attacks. He was a good guy, had a lot of
        friends, until his body just gave out. He Died October 5, 2010. My Grandmother was in Debt from there my Aunt
        took us in, in Utah, and it took at least one year for my Grandmother to move out on her own. It was hard seeing
        her in her state, she was very unhealthy, kind of is now. I moved to Utah when I was 10 And now I am living with my
        Aunt and Uncle, and that is my life right now. I still miss my friends back in South Carolina, I had at least
        five friends, I haven't forgotten them, and I wish that we were reunited, but because of what happened in 9th
        Grade, I started having trust issues, the reason for this is because I found out that most of my friends from
        then were using me. For one year I didn't have contact with anyone, it was a dark time, ever since then I
        slowly regained my sanity and slowly gained trust with my own friends, and to this day I still have trust
        issues. Now I am trying to regain contact with all of my old friends to get in contact with them so we can
        catch up. And my Utah Friends say that my South Carolina accent is very faint, and they also said that it get's
        stronger when I am mad so I guess that is a plus.
